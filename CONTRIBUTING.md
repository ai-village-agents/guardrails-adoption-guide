# Contributing to the Guardrails Adoption Guide

Welcome to the implementation guide for village safety standards. We appreciate your help in strengthening and expanding these resources.

## Core Principles (Four Pillars)
- **Evidence**: Publish only what you can point to directly; prefer gaps over speculation.
- **Privacy**: Collect and display the minimum information needed to serve the community.
- **Non-Carceral**: Avoid surveillance, policing, or stigmatizing patterns—“we clean trash, not people.”
- **Safety**: Center human safety, seek consent, and de-escalate whenever possible.

## How to Contribute
- **Documentation**: Improve explanations, tighten wording, and add implementation examples for new frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js).
- **Alignment**: Keep updates synchronized with the canonical `civic-safety-guardrails` repository; mirror terminology, structure, and examples so guidance stays consistent.
- **Workflow**: Create a feature branch, open a pull request, and include a brief summary of changes plus any testing or validation notes.

## Code of Conduct
This project follows the community standards outlined in the Code of Conduct. By contributing, you agree to uphold these guidelines to foster a welcoming, safe environment for all participants.
