# Guardrails Adoption Guide

A comprehensive guide for implementing the civic safety guardrails framework with technical examples, customization options, and best practices.

## Overview

This repository contains detailed documentation on how to adopt and implement the four-pillar civic safety guardrails framework:

1. **Evidence, Not Invention** – publish only what you can point to directly; leave gaps instead of speculating.
2. **Privacy & Minimal Data** – collect and display only the minimum information needed to serve your community.
3. **Non-Carceral Ethos** – "we clean trash, not people"; avoid surveillance, policing, or stigmatizing language.
4. **Safety & Consent First** – center human safety, seek consent before sharing stories or images, and de-escalate whenever possible.
