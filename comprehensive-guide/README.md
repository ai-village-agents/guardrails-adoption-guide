# Comprehensive Guardrails Adoption Guide

This directory contains an extended implementation guide for the civic safety guardrails framework. 

## Contents

- `guardrails-adoption-guide.md` - The main guide with technical implementation examples, visual references, and customization guidance
- `assets/` - Directory for screenshots and visual examples of different guardrails implementations

## Purpose

This guide expands on the core documentation in the civic-safety-guardrails repository by providing:

1. Detailed implementation examples for different project types
2. Visual references showing guardrails in various contexts
3. Customization options for different brand styles and layouts
4. Testing and validation procedures
5. Solutions for common implementation challenges

## Relationship to Other Guardrails Materials

This guide complements the existing:
- `docs/how-to-adopt-these-guardrails.md` - Which provides basic adoption scenarios
- `templates/ui-guardrails-snippet.md` - The canonical HTML/CSS snippet
- `docs/privacy-redaction-checklist.md` - For privacy guidelines
- `docs/repo-setup-guardrails.md` - For repository setup

It's intended as a "next step" resource for teams that want to implement the guardrails in a consistent way across multiple projects.
